# Database Connection Optimization Guide

## Problem Solved
Your Go backend was experiencing intermittent connection failures to Supabase due to:
- No connection pooling
- No retry logic
- Inadequate timeouts
- No connection health monitoring

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Connection Pooling
- **Max Open Connections**: 25 (optimal for Render's free tier)
- **Max Idle Connections**: 5 (keeps connections warm)
- **Connection Lifetime**: 1 hour (prevents stale connections)
- **Idle Timeout**: 5 minutes (cleans up unused connections)

### 2. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
- **Max Retries**: 5 attempts
- **Initial Delay**: 2 seconds
- **Backoff Multiplier**: 2x (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s)
- **Context Timeouts**: 10 seconds for connection, 5 seconds for health checks

### 3. Connection String Optimization
Added optimal parameters for cloud deployment:
```
sslmode=require
connect_timeout=10
statement_timeout=30000
idle_in_transaction_session_timeout=30000
tcp_keepalives_idle=600
tcp_keepalives_interval=30
tcp_keepalives_count=3
```

### 4. Health Monitoring
- **Health Check Endpoint**: `/api/health`
- **Database Middleware**: Automatic connection validation per request
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup on server termination

### 5. Server Optimizations
- **Read Timeout**: 15 seconds
- **Write Timeout**: 15 seconds
- **Idle Timeout**: 60 seconds
- **Graceful Shutdown**: 30-second timeout

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your Render deployment:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.fxqrwbrbumhjlqowglcx:Owais%40786@aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?sslmode=require
EduFlow_API=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

## Monitoring Endpoints

### Health Check
```bash
GET /api/health
```
Returns:
- `200 OK` if database is healthy
- `503 Service Unavailable` if database is down

### Basic Test
```bash
GET /api/hello
```
Returns: "Hello from Go backend"

## Supabase Configuration Recommendations

### 1. Connection Pooling Settings
In your Supabase dashboard:
- **Pool Size**: 15-20 (leave room for other connections)
- **Pool Mode**: Transaction (recommended for most apps)
- **Statement Timeout**: 30 seconds

### 2. Database Settings
- **Max Connections**: 100 (default is usually fine)
- **Idle Timeout**: 10 minutes
- **Connection Timeout**: 10 seconds

## Render Deployment Settings

### 1. Environment Variables
Set these in your Render service settings:
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_connection_string
EduFlow_API=your_frontend_url
```

### 2. Build Command
```bash
go build -o app
```

### 3. Start Command
```bash
./app
```

### 4. Health Check Path
Set to: `/api/health`

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Refused Errors
1. Check if Supabase is experiencing issues
2. Verify your connection string is correct
3. Check if your IP is whitelisted (if using IP restrictions)
4. Monitor the `/api/health` endpoint

### High Connection Usage
1. Reduce `MaxOpenConns` to 15-20
2. Increase `ConnMaxIdleTime` to 10 minutes
3. Check for connection leaks in your code

### Slow Queries
1. Add database indexes
2. Optimize your SQL queries
3. Consider using prepared statements

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
- Database connection count
- Response times
- Error rates
- Memory usage

### Logs to Monitor
- Connection retry attempts
- Health check failures
- Server startup/shutdown events

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Use Prepared Statements
For frequently executed queries, use prepared statements to improve performance.

### 2. Implement Caching
Consider adding Redis or in-memory caching for frequently accessed data.

### 3. Database Indexing
Ensure your database has proper indexes for your query patterns.

### 4. Connection Monitoring
Consider adding metrics collection (Prometheus, etc.) for production monitoring.

## Testing the Optimizations

1. Deploy the updated code to Render
2. Test the health endpoint: `curl https://your-app.onrender.com/api/health`
3. Monitor the logs for connection retry attempts
4. Test under load to ensure stability

The optimizations should significantly reduce connection failures and improve overall reliability.
